# üèéÔ∏è  F1 Insights: Real-Time Replay & Historical Analytics üèÅ

## Project Overview

A real-time Formula 1 telemetry system and historical data analysis system that captures, processes, and visualizes car data during race sessions, enabling both live replay and historical analysis.

The project involves two main components:

- **Real-Time Race Replay** - Replay and analyze race events in real-time, diving deep into how and why outcomes occurred
- **Historical Analysis** - Post-race analysis of weather impacts, tire choices, and race/pit strategies

### Real-Time Race Replay

The system reconstructs race sessions in real-time, providing insights through:

- Driver performance metrics (speed, throttle, brake data)
- DRS usage analysis
- Gear selection patterns
- Position changes and overtaking maneuvers

### Historical Analysis & Strategic Insights

The system enables comprehensive post-race analysis focusing on:

- Weather impact on tire degradation and pit timing
- Pit strategy effectiveness across conditions
- Tire compound performance analysis

## Architecture & Technology Stack

## Technical Decisions

### Grafana Setup
- EC2 deployment for 1s refresh rates (vs. 5s cloud limitation)
- Dual setup: EC2 for real-time, Cloud for historical analysis

### Database Choices
- SingleStore for real-time operations (ms latency, free tier)
- Snowflake for historical analysis (scalable compute/storage)
